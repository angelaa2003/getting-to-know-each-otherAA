	<h2 style="font-size: x-large;">Introduction</h2>
	<p>My name is Angela Alfaro but my preffered name is Angie. I am a first generation bilingual student 19 years old, currently majoring in <i>Criminal Justice</i>
		for a Masters degree and a double major of <i>Cyber Security</i>. I am planning in the future to join the FBI &#128110 on the sworn law enforcement agency out in the feild.
		I have two magnificent parents who have always supported me and have been a great role model for me since birth. My hard working dad who only wants 
		whats best for her two daughters, and there is my mom who is a hosue wife making sure we are headed in the right direction in life. An interesting fact 
		about me is I ride my own horse named <i>Chocoflan</i> he's such an amazing horse we have a state winning streak of 5. This isn't a well recognized horse 
		back riding sport, there are eight girls riding horses in a synchronized routine very dangerous by the way with a 15mph speed. This isn't a horse back 
		riding sport where you ride normal with both legs, this sport contains of your right leg crossed over and if not we get points deducted from our score. 
		Including we need to wear these big sombreros with dresses and boots Very interesting and not many people know about this sport that has been living
		since the 1920's.
